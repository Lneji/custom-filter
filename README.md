custom-filter
=============

This project is a custom extension project for eXo Platform that contains a custom filter. This filter will redirect 
the corrupted pages to a 404 not found error page. In fact, the default behavior in eXo is to redirect to homepage
when the url contains a non existing page, this is the expected behavior that the root node is displayed if the
requested URL point to an unfounded node. This project will override the default behavior.
